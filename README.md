# Multi-Step-LSTM-Time-Series-Forecasting-Models-for-Power-Usage

🚀 Excited to share my latest project on Multi-Step LSTM Time Series Forecasting for Power Usage!

In this project, I leveraged Python and machine learning to build a powerful forecasting model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. By applying MinMax scaling to normalize the data and defining appropriate time steps, I trained the model to predict power usage over multiple future time steps. The key features of the project include:

🔍 Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and scaled power usage data using MinMaxScaler for efficient training.

⏳ Sequence Creation: Split the time series into sequences of past observations, enabling the LSTM model to capture temporal patterns and dependencies.

📊 Model Training: Developed an LSTM-based model to forecast power usage over multiple time steps, ensuring accuracy with metrics like Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Error.

💡 Insights: The model showed strong performance in predicting future power usage, proving the effectiveness of LSTMs for time series forecasting tasks.

I’m excited about how this model can potentially help optimize energy usage, improve load forecasting, and contribute to more efficient power management systems.
